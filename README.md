# JUnit Testing
This repository contains a few simple classes that all contain a corresponding testing component that mostly validates user input. These unit tests show off the importance that automated test cases can have in terms of expediting development, catching issues early, and submitting sounder code. Manual testing may be necessary for testing more subjective facets of a product, such as how the UI feels when it is being navigated, but components where data can be checked objectively are prime candidates for unit testing.

Also included is a summary and reflection report that goes into more detail regarding the process of building these tests and thoughts on software testing in general.

# General Thoughts on Development and Importance of Testing
## Ensuring code, programs, or software is functional and secure?

Implementing secure coding principles is a discipline of its own that is multifaceted. Updating dependencies, using secure algorithms for encryption, hashing sensitive data, validating input, and assuming all data is untrusted are among the many principles one can follow to help secure a codebase. Maintaining proper functionality falls under the discipline of software testing and is also a complicated, sophisticated aspect of software engineering. For actual functionality of the code, testing is classified by different levels depending on the scope being testing. Unit testing can be used to test the functionality of small testable units of code for proper functionality. These unit tests can then be integrated together during integration testing to ensure that they function properly when used together. Further yet, systems testing seeks to evaluate the functionality of a fully integrated system, or in other words, testing the system as a whole.

##	Interpreting user needs

Interpreting user needs can be a fickle and ambiguous aspect of the software development process. Often, users do not know exactly what they need or want in a program other than a vague or general idea. In the Agile methodology, the software development lifecycle seeks to better develop these initial requirements and 
establish user stories as well as related test cases in order to incorporate these requirements into the program. This process is iterative in nature and often relies on constant user feedback to fully flesh out needs while working towards a finished product.

##	Approaching design

Software applications are generally not written by a single developer but rather a team of many disciplines working together. Understanding the software development lifecycle and having a structure that the entire team agrees upon when planning and designing software is imperative. These processes are a systematic and often standard approach to designing software as they provide a plan to tackle gathering requirements from a client, analyzing the constraints, breaking the requirements down, distributing the workload, testing the application, and finally delivering an iteration to a client for feedback before the process begins again. With so many facets of an application requiring specific knowledge and expertise, special care in studying documentation and researching technologies intended to be used were vital for me to more confidently choose the approach that is most appropriate for the design.
